<p>(7/2018) Nearly four months ago, my son emerged in magnificent goa’uld fashion from his beloved host and onto our relatively cold, dry planet, sternly critical of me for not making more of my 28-years of preparation for his arrival. Perhaps it was some newly activated dad-neurotransmitters, divine intervention, or a tap on the shoulder from the ethereal universal consciousness, but I was swiftly imbued with a profound impulse to do something <i>just a little more significant</i> with each passing moment. The sage advice of my former scoutmaster (ret. Army officer) has replayed in my mind perpetually since, “Boys, quit standing around playing grab-ass! Make something happen!”</p>

<p>My intent in this blog is to chronicle my journey up Machine Learning Mountain and provide a place where I can explain my rediscovered passion, goals and ultimate vision to my family in practical terms. I'll also try to demonstrate personally meaningful implementations of the tools I encounter along the way.</p>

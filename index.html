<p>Nearly four months ago, my son emerged in magnificent goa’uld fashion from his beloved host and onto our relatively cold, dry planet, sternly critical of me for not making more of my 28-years of preparation for his arrival. Perhaps it was some newly activated dad-neurotransmitters, divine intervention, or a tap on the shoulder from the ethereal universal consciousness, but I was swiftly imbued with a profound impulse to do something <i>just a little more significant</i> with each passing moment. The sage advice of my former Scoutmaster (ret. Army officer) has replayed in my mind perpetually since, “Boys, quit standing around playing grab-ass! Make something happen!”</p>

<p>I had contemplated the field of machine learning during college and even stocked my senior year with related course material (Bayesian networks, big data analysis, engineering statistics, etc.), but ultimately followed the practical path and settled into an enterprise application development role where I've thoroughly enjoyed creating mental health tools for half a decade (and subsequently forgotten most of the funky data maths that I thought were superfly back in the day).</p>

<p>With eerie sychronicity, a couple of weeks after my son's birth and while strenuously contemplating <i>how exactly to stop playing grab-ass and start making something happen</i>, I received an invitation to an online "Data Science" scholarship competition. It was a dumb competition (i.e., I didn't get selected), but it reignited that same excitement for the field that had captivated me years before. With an endless internet of resources, I began charting my new course.</p>

<p>My intent in this blog is to chronicle my journey up Machine Learning Mountain and provide a place where I can explain my new passion-hobby, goals and ultimate vision to my family in practical terms. I'll also try to demonstrate personally meaningful implementations of the tools I encounter along the way.</p>

Nearly four months ago, my son emerged in classic goa'uld fashion from his beloved host and onto our cold, dry planet, crtically judging me for all of my flaws, failures and missed opportunities over the 28 years _that I should have been here preparing things for him_. Perhaps some newly activated dad-neurotransmitters, divine intervention, or a tap on the shoulder from the universal consciousness is responsible for triggering in me a profound impulse to do something a little more significant with each passing moment. The sage advice of my former Scoutmaster has replayed perpetually since, "Alright boys, quit standing around playing grab-ass! Make something happen!"

Around that same time, I received an invitation to a Udacity Nanodegree Data Science scholarship competition. The competition has been so-so, but the connections and resources I've gained in the process have reignited in me something resembling a direction in which to unfurl my newly acquired sense of urgency. I had explored the idea of data analysis during my senior year of college, and even took graduate-level courses in statistics, "Big Data Analysis" and "Bayesian Networks and Descision Graphs," but software application development was safe and in demand, so I took the broad path in starting my career.

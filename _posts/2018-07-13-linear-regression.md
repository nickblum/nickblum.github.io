Herein lies the very first of an enthralling, indefinite-part series. I'll attempt to convince you, Dear Reader, that despite the typical scary/magical perception of the inevitable Super-Duper Artificial Intelligence likely to kill/enslave/conduct-fascinating-experiments-upon humanity sometime in the next, oh I don't know, six-months or so, there's also a soft side that warrants thoughtful contemplation and perhaps even tender embrace. I'd like to present that soft side here.
	
I'll be trying to explain some fancy pants machine learning concepts at an accessible level, because 1) I barely know what I'm doing, and 2) my likely audience consists of my darling wife who, despite my best efforts, would prefer spending her time engaged in anything but math and my infant son who is only just beginning to operate his Ti-89 and similar baby milestones.

## Sticks and Stones

One basic goal of machine learning is to give a computer a set of experiences and allow it to make reasonable predictions about the outcome of _new_ experiences of a similar type. It's kind of like _people learning_. In some [advanced applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn4nRCC9TwQ){:target="_blank"}, the computer may not have any experiences to begin with; it will just have to experiment until it discovers some things about its environment all by itself. This can seem a little magical, but perhaps less so once we take a peek under the hood. 

As humans, most of us are already pretty good at spotting trends and making predictions about our environment:

>_Johnny and Morton both got motorcycles._ **(observation)**  
>_Maybe I should get a motorcycle, too?_ **(prediction/trend)**  

>_You ate the last piece of cake?!_ **(observation)**  
>_I CAN NEVER TRUST YOU AGAIN!!!_ **(prediction/trend)**

We can often represent these intuitions visually to help quickly get the point across to other humans:

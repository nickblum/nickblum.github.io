Nearly four months ago, my son emerged in magnificent goa’uld fashion from his beloved host and onto our relatively cold, dry planet, sternly critical of me for not making more of my 28-years of preparation. Perhaps it was some newly activated dad-neurotransmitters, divine intervention, or a tap on the shoulder from the ethereal universal consciousness, but I was swiftly imbued with a profound impulse to do something _just a little more significant_ with each passing moment. The sage advice of my former Scoutmaster (ret. Army officer) has replayed in mind perpetually since, “Boys, quit standing around playing grab-ass! Make something happen!”

I had contemplated the field of machine learning during college, and even took graduate-level courses in some relevant areas - engineering statistics, differential equations, linear algebra, big data analysis and Bayesian networks - but ultimately followed the practical path and settled into an enterprise application development role where I've thoroughly enjoyed creating mental health tools for half a decade (and subsequently forgotten most of the funky data maths that I thought were superfly back in the day).

With eerie sychronicity, a couple of weeks after my son's birth and while strenuously contemplating _how exactly to stop playing grab-ass and start making something happen_, I received an invitation to an online "Data Science" scholarship competition. It was a dumb competition (i.e., I didn't get selected), but it reignited that same excitement for the field that captivated me years before. With an endless internet of resources, I began charting my new direction.

My intent in this blog is to chronicle my journey up Machine Learning Mountain and provide a place where I can explain my passion hobby to my family in practical terms. I'll also try to demonstrate personally meaningful implementations of the tools I encounter along the way.

## Sticks and Stones

The fundamental goal of "machine learning" is to give a computer a set of steps to follow so that it can make predictions given a set of observations, kind of like, ya know, _learning_. But as humans, pattern recognition and predictions are our some of our finest qualities. For example:

_Johnny and Morton both got motorcycles..._ **(observation)**  
_Maybe I should get a motorcycle, too?_ **(prediction/trend)**  

_You ate the last piece of cake?!_ **(observation)**  
_I CAN NEVER TRUST YOU AGAIN!!!_ **(prediction/trend)**

We can often represent these intuitions visually to help get the point accross to other humans:

### Plots



### Slopes

Nearly four months ago, my son emerged in magnificent goa’uld fashion from his beloved host and onto our relatively cold, dry planet, sternly critical of me for not making more of my 28-years of preparation. Perhaps it was some newly activated dad-neurotransmitters, divine intervention, or a tap on the shoulder from the ethereal universal consciousness, but I was swiftly imbued with a profound impulse to do something a little more significant with each passing moment. The sage advice of my former Scoutmaster has replayed perpetually since, “Alright boys, quit standing around playing grab-ass! Make something happen!” I still don't know what it means to play grab-ass, but I think I need to make something happen.

I had contemplated the field of AI/machine learning/data analysis during college, and even took graduate-level courses in some relevant areas - engineering statistics, differential equations, linear algebra, big data analysis and Bayesian networks - but ultimately took the practical road and settled into an enterprise application development role where I've thoroughly enjoyed creating mental health tools for half a decade.

With eerie sychronicity, a couple of weeks after my son's birth and while contemplating how to optimise my time allotted for the betterment of my family and the human race, I received an invitation to a Udacity Nanodegree Data Science scholarship competition. It was a simple exercise, but it reignited that same excitement for the field that captivated me years ago. I suddenly had a direction.

My intent in this blog is to chronicle my journey up Machine Learning Mountain and provide a place where I can explain my passion hobby to my family in practical terms. I'll also try to demonstrate personally meaningful implementations of the tools I encounter along the way.

## Sticks and Stones

A fundamental goal of machine learning is to make predictions given a set of observations. But as humans, pattern recognition and predictions are our some of our finest qualities. For example:

_Johnny and Morton both got motorcycles..._ **(observation)**  
_Maybe I should get a motorcycle, too?_ **(prediction/trend)**  

_You ate the last piece of cake?!_ **(observation)**  
_I CAN NEVER TRUST YOU AGAIN!!!_ **(prediction/trend)**

We can often represent these truths visually to help get the point accross to other humans:

### Plots



### Slopes
